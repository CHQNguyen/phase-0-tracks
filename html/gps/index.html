What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
HTML semantic tags are used to divide up a website into various section that you can add content to.  A perfect example when i google html sementic tags google shows a paper divided up with the top being header then nav.  Next the article and section the footer last and aside on the side.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?  The browser would start at the root of your element tag which is the <html> tag and work its way down.  The header and nav and all of its content.  Followed by the main then aside and footer.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
Sublime and tremulously help you save time if you are willing to set it up.  Having pre-created snippets can save you a lot of repeat work.  I definitely plan on creating more snippets to help me with html.  Such as a table snippet or chart.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
understand the order of how every element stack up to one another is the most difficult part.  i think constant working to create website and playing with examples and creating my own website will definitely help me better understand these concepts.
